So similar to network connections, docker is isolated from underlying memory storage of the host as well. 

The data, when the container is running, gets stored into the container. And this is similar to volatile memory on your system. 
Once the docker container is restarted or stopped the data is lost. 

The rule of thumb is to keep the container stateless, that is to make sure that the container stores all its data externally on a database (sql) or distributed cache (redis)
But if we do want it to be stateful, we have to incorporate volumes into our docker container. 

Volumes can be cloud storage methods like Azure File Storage on Azure or Amazon S3 on AWS or we can use the host machine as well. 
In order to use the host machine as persistent storage, we can use the -v flag and map a host directory to a container directory like so:

> docker run -v /my/host/dir:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql
here /my/host/dir : directory on the host 
/var/lib/mysql/   : directory on the container 

so everytime the container is stopped or restarted, the data is persistent.
