Docker containers run from docker images. So if docker images are not presented locally, it is obtained from a registery. 
DockerHub is one such popular registry. Private registeries exsist as well.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

note : 
When an image is published to a registry, its name must be:
<repository_name>/<name>:<tag>
    tag is optional; when missing, it is considered to be latest by default
    repository_name can be a registry DNS or the name of a registry in the Docker Hub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> docker pull <image_name>
This command pulls the image from a registry, even if present.

> docker run <image_name>
This command (if image does not exist) pulls the image and starts the container 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can create our own docker images as well, this will keep our programs and their respective dependencies together.
Docker images are created using 'docker build' command and a 'Dockerfile' file.

> docker rmi <image_name>
The above command removes the image 

Youâ€™re free to tag your images however you want. Common tags include:
    a version number, e.g. hello:1.0, hello:1.1, hello:1.2
    a Git commit tag, e.g. hello:2cd7e376, hello:b43a14bb
like : 
docker build -t hello:1.0 .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Images are stored in registries :
    Docker Hub, where you pay according to the number of private repositories used.
    Azure Container Registry allows you to have your own private registry in Azure.
    GitLab has an included optional Docker registry; enable it so that each project can store the images it creates.
    The registry image allows you to host your own registry on a Docker enabled machine as a container.

Take a look at Multi-Stage Dockerfiles 
This enables us to use a certain features from FAt-images, but use a thin-image as our container base.
